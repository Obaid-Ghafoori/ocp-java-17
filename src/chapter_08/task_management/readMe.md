# Task Management Application
## Overview

A simple task management application demonstrating the use of Java built-in functional interfaces and JDK-17 features.

In this application, we'll:

1. Define Tasks: Create a Task class to represent individual tasks.
2. Filter Tasks: Use Predicate to filter tasks based on certain criteria.
3. Transform Tasks: Use Function to transform task descriptions.
4. Perform Actions: Use Consumer to perform actions on tasks.
5. Generate Tasks: Use Supplier to generate new tasks.



## Features

- **Encapsulation**: Demonstrates encapsulation with a `Task` class.
- **Lambdas and Functional Interfaces**: Uses various built-in functional interfaces such as `Predicate`, `Function`, `Consumer`, and `Supplier`.
- **Data Manipulation**: Provides functionalities to filter, transform, and perform actions on tasks.

## Requirements

- Java 17
- IntelliJ IDEA (or any other IDE supporting Java)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Obaid-Ghafoori/ocp-java-17.git
   cd chatper_08/task-management
