                Definition: An interface in Java is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, %smethod signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Interfaces cannot contain %sinstance fields or constructors.
                                 
                Purpose: \tInterfaces are used to specify a set of methods that a class must implement, %spromoting a form of multiple inheritance and providing a way to achieve abstraction.

                RULES
                --------
                   1. Interface Access Modifiers:
                             public: The interface is accessible from any other class.
                             default (package-private): The interface is accessible only within its own package.
                   
                  2. Default Methods:
                             Methods in an interface that have a body. These methods can be overridden by implementing classes.
                             
                  3. Static methods:  
                             Methods in an interface that belong to the interface itself, not to instances of the interface
                             In other words it can be accessible from the implementing class by referencing interface name
                             e.g. in the Smartphone class call status as -> Device.status                
                 """;
