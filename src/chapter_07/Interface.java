/**
 * Definition: An interface in Java is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants,
 * method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types.
 * Interfaces cannot contain instance fields or constructors.
 *
 * Purpose: Interfaces are used to specify a set of methods that a class must implement, promoting a form of
 * multiple inheritance and providing a way to achieve abstraction.
